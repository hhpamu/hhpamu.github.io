Education
======
* **Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering - Research**, Carnegie Mellon University, May 2024
* **Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering**, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, May 2022


Work experience
======
* **Undergraduate Research Assistant at Juarez Research Group**, University of Illinois, January 2021-May 2022
  * Developed a modified Vicsek model in MATLAB to incorporate physical boundaries
  * Modelled elastic collisions and implemented particle trajectory visualization using plot function
  * Implemented data collection and organization features for exporting simulation data
  * Built a hydrodynamic treadmill with a scale-free vertical microscope, to observe bacteria growth in oil-water interfaces in ocean conditions
  * Designed and fabricated 100:1 and 5:1 reduction ratio gear sets using laser cut acrylic for controlling the speed of the treadmill chamber

* **Undergraduate Research Assistant at Monolithic Systems Lab**, University of Illinois, May 2021-May 2022
  * Designed and fabricated flexible connectors using 500 psi Dragon Skin 30 silicone to emulate a physical pin joint for Fiber Reinforced Elastomeric Enclosures (FREEs) with the end goal of building a network of FREEs for applications in other robotics projects
  * Designed custom parts for injection molding of connectors using Creo and 3D printed the molds
  * Developed a modified silicone injection molding fabrication method for connectors
  * Manufactured custom FREEs for testing connectors using rubber tubes, cotton fiber and rubber cement
  * Tested flexible connectors for FREEs to determine operating pressures of a simple FREE-FREE-rigid member structure and identify areas of improvement, consequently, added rigid constraints to flexible connectors to increase operating pressure

* **MechSE Innovation Studio Volunteer**, University of Illinois, March 2020-May 2022
  * Assisted an average of 15 students per day in setting 3D prints for mechanical design and project-based courses
  * Troubleshooted technical maintenance issues of 3D Printer equipment to ensure smooth operation by fixing position of carriage on guide rails and programming printer to re-calibrate settings 
  * Monitored student prints for quality and prevented failures

* **American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME)**, University of Illinois, August 2019-April 2020
  * Member of the Special Projects committee involved in building interactive exhibits for Homecoming in Fall and Engineering Open House (EOH) in Spring
  * Designed arm mechanism of the 2019 Homecoming float, The Alma Mater
  * Constructed the Strandbeest interactive exhibit for 2020 Engineering Open House (EOH) (repurposed for 2021 EOH) using Creo and laser cut wood

<!--
* **Illinois Formula Electric**, University of Illinois, August 2019-December 2019
  * Part of the Aerodynamics and Composites subsystem
  * Used ANSYS to work on aerodynamics of front and rear wings of 2020 car and improve aerodynamic performance accordingly
  * Assisted in fabrication and assembly of front and rear spoilers
