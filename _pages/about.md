Hello! I am Hima Pamu, I graduated with a B.S. in mechanical engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). I am an output-driven problem solver with a drive to develop novel solutions. I have a passion for all things mechanical and I personally feel connected to machines. I like to learn by doing, building and testing, as such, I see myself as an experimentalist. I have considerable experience designing and fabricating things. I am proficient in Computer-Aided Design, Manufacturing, Kinematics, and Dynamics. 

My undergrad research endeavors at UIUC include designing flexible connectors for elastomeric actuators to build an actuator mesh. I also designed a hydrodynamic treadmill for observing bacteria growth on oil interfaces. In addition, I volunteered at the MechSE Innovation Studio in my free time, where I assisted students in 3D printing and troubleshooting manufacturing problems.

In my free time, I read fiction, play Military Simulation (MilSim) style tactical shooter video games and play airsoft matches to have outdoor adventures.
