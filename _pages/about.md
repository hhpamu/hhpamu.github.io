Hello! I am Hima Pamu, a rising senior in mechanical engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I am an output-driven problem solver with the plasticity of working on any engineering problem. I have substantial experience designing and fabricating things from my design classes. I am knowledgeable in Kinematics, Dynamics, Fluid mechanics, and Heat transfer. I have been active in several organizations over my undergrad and garnered various skills from each undertaking.

I am passionate about soft robotics and compliant mechanisms. My recent endeavors in research include designing flexible connectors for elastomeric actuators to build a mesh of actuators for demonstration and education. I am also designing a hydrodynamic treadmill for observing bacteria growth on oil interfaces. In addition, I volunteer at the MechSE Innovation Studio in my free time, apply the knowledge from my classes in my projects, and tinker with almost any tool or machine I can.
