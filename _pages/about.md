Hello! I am Hima Pamu, a graduate student researcher at Biohybrid and Organic Robotics Group (B.O.R.G.) at the Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). I graduated with a B.S. in mechanical engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). I am an output-driven problem solver with a drive to develop novel solutions. I have a passion for all things mechanical and I personally feel connected to machines. I like to learn by doing, building and testing, as such, I see myself as an experimentalist. I have considerable experience designing and fabricating things. 

I am currently working on simulating musclature using <a href="https://www.cosseratrods.org/software/pyelastica/" target="_blank">PyElastica</a> and incorporating adaptability of muscles into the model.

My undergrad research endeavors at UIUC include designing flexible connectors for elastomeric actuators to build an actuator mesh. I also designed a hydrodynamic treadmill for observing bacteria growth on oil interfaces. In addition, I volunteered at the MechSE Innovation Studio in my free time, where I assisted students in 3D printing and troubleshooting manufacturing problems.

In my free time, I read fiction, play first person shooter video games and play airsoft matches to have outdoor adventures.
