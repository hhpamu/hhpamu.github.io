Hello! I am Hima Pamu, currently a graduate student researcher at <a href="https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/faculty/webster-wood-borg.html" target="_blank">Biohybrid and Organic Robotics Group (B.O.R.G.)</a> at the Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). 

I am currently working on simulating musclature using <a href="https://www.cosseratrods.org/software/pyelastica/" target="_blank">PyElastica</a> and modeling muscle adaptability.

I graduated with a B.S. in mechanical engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). 

In my free time, I read fiction, play first person shooter video games and play airsoft matches to have outdoor adventures.

I am an output-driven problem solver with a drive to develop novel solutions. I have a passion for all things mechanical and I personally feel connected to machines. I like to learn by doing, building and testing, as such, I see myself as an experimentalist.

My undergrad research endeavors include designing flexible connectors for elastomeric actuators to build an actuator mesh. I also designed a hydrodynamic treadmill for observing bacteria growth on oil interfaces. In addition, I volunteered at the MechSE Innovation Studio in my free time, where I assisted students in 3D printing and troubleshooting manufacturing problems.
