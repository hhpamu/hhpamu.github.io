Hello! 


I am Hima Pamu, currently a Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering - Research track student at the Carnegie Mellon University. I am working on simulating musclature using <a href="https://www.cosseratrods.org/software/pyelastica/" target="_blank">PyElastica</a> and modeling muscle adaptability as a graduate student researcher at <a href="https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/faculty/webster-wood-borg.html" target="_blank">Biohybrid and Organic Robotics Group (B.O.R.G.)</a>. I am interested in design, manufacturing and simulation problems in engineering, My work at BORG focuses on developing biohybrid robot simulation tools.

I graduated with a B.S. in mechanical engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). My undergrad research endeavors include designing flexible connectors for elastomeric actuators to build an actuator mesh under <a href="https://ise.illinois.edu/directory/profile/gkrishna" target="_blank">Dr. Girish Krishnan</a>. Simultaneously, I worked with <a href="https://mechse.illinois.edu/people/profile/gjuarez" target="_blank">Dr. Gabriel Juarez</a> to design a hydrodynamic treadmill for observing bacteria growth on oil interfaces. In addition, I volunteered at the <a href="https://mechse.illinois.edu/undergraduate/makerworks/jackson-innovation-studio" target="_blank">MechSE Innovation Studio</a> in my free time, where I assisted students in 3D printing and troubleshooting manufacturing problems.

My past and current projects are listed in the Portifolio page. A complete list of my experiences and proficiencies is on the CV page. A PDF version of my resume is also available at the top of that page.

I am an output-driven problem solver with a drive to develop novel solutions. I have a passion for all things mechanical and I personally feel connected to machines. I like to learn by doing, building and testing, as such, I see myself as an experimentalist.

My undergrad research endeavors include designing flexible connectors for elastomeric actuators to build an actuator mesh. I also designed a hydrodynamic treadmill for observing bacteria growth on oil interfaces. In addition, I volunteered at the MechSE Innovation Studio in my free time, where I assisted students in 3D printing and troubleshooting manufacturing problems.

In my free time, I read fiction, play first person shooter video games and play airsoft matches to have outdoor adventures.
