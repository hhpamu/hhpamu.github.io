This is a final project for <a href="https://courses.illinois.edu/schedule/2022/spring/ME/470">ME 470: Senior Design Project</a>.


In this project, the design challenge required students to build a 3D Printer enclosure that would enable the Grainger <a href="https://www.library.illinois.edu/enx/idea-lab/">Innovation, Discovery, Design, and Data (IDEA)</a> Lab to process longer, larger, and more complex print times that may take multiple days. This would provide them with additional capabilities to print more types of 3D models for their supported Senior Design, Capstone, and other research and learning projects. At the time of proposal, the IDEA lab personnel were limited by print times as there were concerns with safety by running machines for long periods of time without supervision. By providing the the following functionality, it would provide them with the ability to process more complex and larger models:
* Fire sensor that would trigger a fire extinguisher or other fire suppression system in the enclosure
* Webcam that would be networked so to remotely monitor the printers
* Compartment to house 3D printer filament to better control humidity exposure as humidity caused a filament brittleness
* Thermometer and humidity sensor to monitor temperature and humidity inside the enclosure
* Dehumidifier inside to again, better control humidity
* Ports for air ventilation, including mounted system fans to expel hot air
* Accommodate different sized 3D Printers including the Original Prusa i3 MK3S+, Lulzbot Taz 5, Lulzbot Taz Pro, Lulzbot Taz Pro XT, and Elegoo Mars and Elegoo Saturn 3D Printers
* Maintain optimum conditions
  * Temperature: 62 to 68 degrees Fahrenheit
  * Humidity: 0-15%
