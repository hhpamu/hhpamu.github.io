This is a final project for <a href="https://courses.illinois.edu/schedule/2022/spring/ME/470">ME 470: Senior Design Project</a>.


In this project, the design challenge required students to build a 3D Printer enclosure that will enable the Grainger <a href="https://www.library.illinois.edu/enx/idea-lab/">Innovation, Discovery, Design, and Data (IDEA)</a> Lab to process longer, larger, and more complex print times that may take multiple days. This will provide them with additional capabilities to print more types of 3D models for their supported Senior Design, Capstone, and other research and learning projects. At the time of proposal, the IDEA lab personnel are limited by print times as there were concerns with safety by running machines for long periods of time without supervision. By providing the the following functionality, it would provide them with the ability to process more complex and larger models
* Include a fire sensor that would trigger a fire extinguisher or other fire suppression system in the enclosure.
* Webcam that is networked so we can remotely monitor the printers.
* Include a compartment to house 3D printer filament to better control how much humidity it is exposed to, humidity causes a lot of problems for filament.
* Include a thermometer and humidity sensor so we can monitor temperature and humidity inside the enclosure.
* Include a dehumidifier inside to again, better control humidity.
* Include ports for air ventilation, including mounted system fans to expel hot air
* Enclosure will need to accommodate different sized 3D Printers including the Original Prusa i3 MK3S+, Lulzbot Taz 5, Lulzbot Taz Pro, Lulzbot Taz Pro XT, and Elegoo Mars and Elegoo Saturn 3D Printers
* Optimum temperature for 3D Printing is 62 to 68 degrees Fahrenheit.
* Optimum humidity between 0-15%
