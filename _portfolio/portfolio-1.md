**Introduction**


This project aims to design and build a rotating fluid chamber based on a Stanford University <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-020-0924-7?proof%3Dt%23Abs1&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1642034900180041&usg=AOvVaw2CDhV_u_gbPzqSTAPZYor0" target="_blank">paper</a>. A modified version was designed and built to observe the bacterial growth on oil-water interfaces and the effects of the increase in bacterial mass on the rise of oil droplets suspended in water. This apparatus assists in the observation of bacterial cultures that grow on oil droplets in oil spills in the ocean.


My contributions to the project include sourcing various components needed to build the setup as referenced on the original paper designing a 100:1 and 5:1 geartrain system to control the speed of the chamber and the mounts for holding the setup. These resulted in the first round of data collection by observing the rise of oil droplets in a simulated ocean condition. In addition, I am currently working on implementing an Arduino motor speed control for a more refined control compared to the presently used voltage control.


**Design**


The designed setup with a 100:1 geartrain is shown in <i>Fig.1</i>. Note that the encoder is directly connected to the chamber shaft. The chamber itself is made of acrylic sheets with Aluminum rings in between and is sealed with adhesive. The gears are made of laser cut acrylic and the mounts are 3D printed. The 5:1 geartrain, shown in <i>Fig.2</i> is also similarly designed and can be swapped between experiments. The parts in the figures are to scale and do not show any screws, bearings and hubs.
