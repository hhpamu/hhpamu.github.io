The goal of this project is to design and build a rotating chamber of fluid, based on a <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-020-0924-7?proof%3Dt%23Abs1&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1642034900180041&usg=AOvVaw2CDhV_u_gbPzqSTAPZYor0">paper</a> by Stanford University. An altered version was designed and built to observe the bacterial growth on oil-water interfaces and the effects of increase in bacterial mass on rise of oil droplets suspended in water. This apparatus assists in the observation of bacterial cultures that grow on oil droplets in oil spills in the ocean.


My contributions to the project include sourcing various components needed to build the setup as referenced on the original paper, designing the gearbox to reduce the speed of the chosen motor, and the mounts for holding the setup. I am currently working on implementing an Arduino motor speed control for a finer control compared to the current voltage control.
