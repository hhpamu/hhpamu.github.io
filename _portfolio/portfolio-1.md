**Introduction**


Muscles adapt under repeated loading to generate increased force and improve performance. This project aims to integrate muscle adaptability to PyElastica models. 
<a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cosseratrods.org" target="_blank">PyElastica</a> is an open-source Python package designed for Cosserat rod based soft body simulations and is developed by the <a href="https://mattia-lab.com/" target="_blank">Gazzola Lab</a> at the University of Illinois.

PyElastica's source code is available <a href="https://github.com/GazzolaLab/PyElastica" target="_blank">here</a>
