This is a final project for <a href="https://courses.illinois.edu/schedule/2019/fall/ME/270">ME 270: Design for Manufacturability</a>.


In this project, the design challenge required students to pick a scrap object from <a href="https://www.macksrecycling.com/">Mack's Twin City Recycling</a> and perform the following:
* A complete Design for Manufacture and Assembly (DFMA) analysis on our product
* Creation of a detailed CAD model of parts of the existing product to generate a detailed Manufacturing Cost Analysis using aPriori software
* Generation and evaluation of new ideas to improve the recyclability of the existing product's parts
* Creation of a detailed CAD model of parts for the redesigned product to generate a detailed Manufacturing Cost Analysis
* A rudimentary Design of Experiment to test the redesigned product
* A comparison of the original product with the redesigned product in terms of cost, function, and quality


I decided to work on an old Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) controller from Mack's recycling. At the conclusion of the course, my project was recognized as one of the top 5 projects among 180 individual student final projects in the course.
