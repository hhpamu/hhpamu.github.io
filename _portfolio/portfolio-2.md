To demonstrate lightweight soft robots configured as a planar and spatial network of pneumatic artificial muscles, soft interfaces that enable robust interconnections between the pneumatic muscles were investigated. Inspired by the compliant flexure nodes in this <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7918530">paper</a>, I designed and built flexible connectors for Fiber Reinforced Elastomeric Enclosures (FREEs) that are capable of emulating a pin joint. The end goal for the connectors was to be able to be incorporated into other robotics projects involving FREEs and for general demonstration purposes.


The prototyping process involved modeling the connectors in PTC Creo Parametric 7.0 (CAD software), 3D printing the molds out of Polylactic Acid (PLA) and Polyvinyl Alcohol (PVA)  and selecting an appropriate silicone type. The manufacturing process started with injecting the silicone into the assembled cope, drag and core, removing the air bubbles in the mold using a vacuum chamber and allowing the silicone to solidify. Post-processing needs to be done on the connectors to ensure that there are no imperfections in the connectors as any bubbles will compromise their strength.


Currently, the connectors are being tested under various pressure, orientation, and configuration to discern their effectiveness. Further improvements to the design may be made according to the testing.
