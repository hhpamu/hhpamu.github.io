This independent study will investigate soft interfaces that enable robust interconnections between the pneumatic muscles. The goal is to demonstrate lightweight soft robots configured as a planar and spatial network of pneumatic artificial muscles. Inspired by the compliant flexure nodes in this <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7918530">paper</a>, I designed and built flexible connectors for Fiber Reinforced Elastomeric Enclosures (FREEs) that are capable of emulating a pin joint. The end goal for the connectors was to be able to be incorporated into other robotics projects involving FREEs and for general demonstration purposes.


The prototyping process involved modeling the connectors in PTC Creo Parametric 7.0 (CAD software), 3D printing the molds out of Polylactic Acid (PLA) and Polyvinyl Alcohol (PVA), and selecting an appropriate silicone type. See Fig.1, 2 and 3 for some of the mold designs. It can be seen that the design of the molds can be easily modified to make connectors of any planar or spatial configuration.

The manufacturing process starts with injecting the silicone into the assembled cope, drag, and core, removing the air bubbles in the mold using a vacuum chamber, and allowing the silicone to solidify. After curing the silicone, the core needs to be dissolved in water to get the crude part. Next, the connectors need to be processed to remove the flashes and remenants of pouring hole and risers, see Fig.4 and 5. As imperfections can compromise its strength, smaller bubbles are punctured and sealed with silicone.

I have been testing the connectors under various pressure, orientation, and configuration to discern their effectiveness. As a result, I improved their effectiveness at higher pressures (from 5 psi to 14 psi), a 64% improvement. According to the testing results, further improvements to the design are to be made. See the videos below.
