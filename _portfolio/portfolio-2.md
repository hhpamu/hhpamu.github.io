This independent study will investigate soft interfaces that enable robust interconnections between the pneumatic muscles. The goal is to demonstrate lightweight soft robots configured as a planar and spatial network of pneumatic artificial muscles. Inspired by the compliant flexure nodes in this <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7918530">paper</a>, I designed and built flexible connectors for Fiber Reinforced Elastomeric Enclosures (FREEs) that are capable of emulating a pin joint. The end goal for the connectors was to be able to be incorporated into other robotics projects involving FREEs and for general demonstration purposes.


The prototyping process involved modeling the connectors in PTC Creo Parametric 7.0 (CAD software), 3D printing the molds out of Polylactic Acid (PLA) and Polyvinyl Alcohol (PVA), and selecting an appropriate silicone type. The manufacturing process started with injecting the silicone into the assembled cope, drag, and core, removing the air bubbles in the mold using a vacuum chamber, and allowing the silicone to solidify. Next, post-processing needs to be done on the connectors to prevent imperfections as any bubbles will compromise their strength.


I have been testing the connectors under various pressure, orientation, and configuration to discern their effectiveness. As a result, I improved their effectiveness at higher pressures (from 5 psi to 14 psi), a 64% improvement. According to the testing results, further improvements to the design are to be made.
