This is a final project paper for <a href="https://courses.illinois.edu/schedule/2020/summer/ME/400">ME 400: Energy Conversion Systems</a>.


The project challenged students to discuss the scope for energy conservation and energy efficiency in the energy conversion industry of their choice. In addition, the project challenged us to investigate the state-of-the-art in our chosen area of energy conversion system/s, which meant that we had to perform research and cite work from recent peer-reviewed journal papers. Finally, we also had to discuss how the widespread implementation of such energy conservation and efficiency measures could affect climate change.


For instance, a student exploring nuclear energy could consider the potential for molten-salt reactors in addition to existing light water reactors. Likewise, a student studying photovoltaics could research novel materials / multi-junction cells/perovskite cells. I chose to explore tidal energy due to its potential for being the most widely available yet underutilized source of renewable energy.
