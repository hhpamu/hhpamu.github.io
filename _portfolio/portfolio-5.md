This is a  passion project, currently in progress, to explore and learn about Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and their applications.
The current application focus is on mapping and surveying physical structures. Potential future applications of such technology range from exploring geological structures and aiding in search & rescue operations. I am still working on finishing the drone and acquiring the LiDAR sensors during breaks between semesters.
