This is a  passion project, currently in progress, to explore and learn about Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and their applications.
The current application focus is on mapping and surveying physical structures<!--â€”potential future applications of such technology range from exploring geological structures and aiding search & rescue operations-->. I am still working on the drone <!--and acquiring the LiDAR sensors during breaks--> between semesters. I am currently constrained by time and money to finish this project. Some of the parts I used so far:

* iFlight SucceX-E F4 MPU6000 Flight Controller GPS F4 FC Built-in OSD BEC Current Sensor Black Box
* iFlight SucceX-E 45A BLHeli_S 4-in-1 ESC 2-6s Electronic Speed Controller Support DSHOT600
* iFlight XING 2206 1700KV Brushless Motors 6S
* NIDICI BN-880 Flight Control GPS Module Dual Module Compass
