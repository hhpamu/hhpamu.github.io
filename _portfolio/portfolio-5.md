This is a  passion project, currently in progress, to explore and learn about Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and their applications.
The current application focus is on mapping and surveying physical structures—potential future applications of such technology range from exploring geological structures and aiding search & rescue operations. I am still finishing the drone and acquiring the LiDAR sensors during breaks between semesters. Some of the parts I used are:

* iFlight SucceX-E F4 MPU6000 Flight Controller GPS F4 FC Built-in OSD BEC Current Sensor Black Box
* iFlight SucceX-E 45A BLHeli_S 4-in-1 ESC 2-6s Electronic Speed Controller Support DSHOT600
* iFlight XING 2206 1700KV Brushless Motors 6S
* NIDICI BN-880 Flight Control GPS Module Dual Module Compass
