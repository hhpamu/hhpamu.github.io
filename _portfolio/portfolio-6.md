In this project, I simulated active matter confined to an enclosed space using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicsek_model">Vicsek model</a> in MATLAB. Building on the primer made by <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/hirashima-group/home">Prof. Tsuyoshi Hirashima</a> of the <a href="https://www.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en">Kyoto University</a>, I modelled elastic collisions using simple momentum and kinetic energy conservation, and implemented particle trajectory visualization using plot function. I also added data collection and organization features for exporting simulation data to excel for third-party analysis.


Interesting flocking of particles was observed at various external noise levels.
