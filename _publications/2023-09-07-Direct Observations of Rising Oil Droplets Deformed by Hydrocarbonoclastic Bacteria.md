In marine environments, microscopic droplets of oil can be transported over large distances in the water column. Bacterial growth on the droplets’ surface can deform the oil–water interface to generate complex shapes and significantly enlarge droplets. Understanding the fate of spilled oil droplets requires bridging these length scales and determining how microscale processes affect the large-scale transport of oil. Here, we describe an experimental setup, the hydrodynamic treadmill, developed to keep rising oil droplets stationary in the lab frame for continuous and direct observation. Oil droplets with radii 10 < R < 100 \\μm were colonized and deformed by bacteria over several days before their effective rising speeds were measured. The rising speeds of deformed droplets were significantly slower than those of droplets without bacteria. This decrease in rising speed is understood by an increase in drag force and a decrease in buoyancy as a result of bio-aggregate formation at the droplet surface. Additionally, we found sinking bio-aggregate particles of oil and bacterial biofilms and quantified their composition using fluorescence microscopy. Our experiments can be adapted to further study the interactions between oil droplets and marine organisms and could significantly improve our understanding of the transport of hydrocarbons and complex aggregates.

excerpt: In marine environments, microscopic droplets of spilled oil can be transported over tens or hundreds kilometers in the water column. As this oil is biodegraded, growing bacteria on the droplets' surface can deform the oil-water interface to generate complex shapes and significantly enlarge droplets. A complete understanding of the fate and transport of spilled oil requires bridging the present gap between these length scales and determining how microscale processes affect large-scale transport of oil. Here, we describe experimental results describing rising oil droplets in a purpose-built hydrodynamic treadmill which rotates to keep droplets stationary in the lab frame for continuous, direct observation. Droplets of radii 10-100 μm are colonized and deformed by bacteria over several days before their rising speeds through the water column are measured. Rising speeds of deformed droplets are significantly slower as a result of bio-aggregate formation at the droplet surface compared to those of droplets of weathered or unweathered oil without bacteria. Additionally, we discover bio-aggregate particles of oil and bacterial biofilms which sink through the water column. The composition of these particles is quantified using fluorescence microscopy. These results have important implications for the study of oil transport following a spill, as colonization by bacteria can cause oil droplets to remain in the water column for months or years longer than otherwise expected. An improved understanding of the physical transformations of oil droplets during biodegradation shows promise for significantly improving models of oil spills. Additionally, the formation of sinking particles of oil and bacteria presents a new vector for hydrocarbon sedimentation and potential marine oil snow formation.
