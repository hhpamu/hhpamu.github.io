In marine environments, microscopic droplets of spilled oil can be transported over tens or hundreds kilometers in the water column. As this oil is biodegraded, growing bacteria on the droplets' surface can deform the oil-water interface to generate complex shapes and significantly enlarge droplets. A complete understanding of the fate and transport of spilled oil requires bridging the present gap between these length scales and determining how microscale processes affect large-scale transport of oil. Here, we describe experimental results describing rising oil droplets in a purpose-built hydrodynamic treadmill which rotates to keep droplets stationary in the lab frame for continuous, direct observation. Droplets of radii 10-100 μm are colonized and deformed by bacteria over several days before their rising speeds through the water column are measured. Rising speeds of deformed droplets are significantly slower as a result of bio-aggregate formation at the droplet surface compared to those of droplets of weathered or unweathered oil without bacteria. Additionally, we discover bio-aggregate particles of oil and bacterial biofilms which sink through the water column. The composition of these particles is quantified using fluorescence microscopy. These results have important implications for the study of oil transport following a spill, as colonization by bacteria can cause oil droplets to remain in the water column for months or years longer than otherwise expected. An improved understanding of the physical transformations of oil droplets during biodegradation shows promise for significantly improving models of oil spills. Additionally, the formation of sinking particles of oil and bacteria presents a new vector for hydrocarbon sedimentation and potential marine oil snow formation.
