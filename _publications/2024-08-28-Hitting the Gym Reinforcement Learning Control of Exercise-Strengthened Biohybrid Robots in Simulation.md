Animals can accomplish many incredible behavioral feats across a wide range of operational environments and scales that current robots struggle to match. One explanation for this performance gap is the extraordinary properties of the biological materials that comprise animals, such as muscle tissue. Using living muscle tissue as an actuator can endow robotic systems with highly desirable properties such as self-healing, compliance, and biocompatibility. Unlike traditional soft robotic actuators, living muscle biohybrid actuators exhibit unique adaptability, growing stronger with use. The dependency of a muscle's force output on its use history endows muscular organisms the ability to dynamically adapt to their environment, getting better at tasks over time. While muscle adaptability is a benefit to muscular organisms, it currently presents a challenge for biohybrid researchers: how does one design and control a robot whose actuators' force output changes over time? Here, we incorporate muscle adaptability into a many-muscle biohybrid robot design and modeling tool, leveraging reinforcement learning as both a co-design partner and system controller. As a controller, our learning agents coordinated the independent contraction of 42 muscles distributed on a lattice worm structure to successfully steer it towards eight distinct targets while incorporating muscle adaptability. As a co-design tool, our agents enable users to identify which muscles are important to accomplishing a given task. Our results show that adaptive agents outperform non-adaptive agents in terms of maximum rewards and training time. Together, these contributions can both enable the elucidation of muscle actuator adaptation and inform the design and modeling of adaptive, performant, many-muscle robots.

excerpt: In marine environments, microscopic droplets of spilled oil can be transported over tens or hundreds kilometers in the water column. As this oil is biodegraded, growing bacteria on the droplets' surface can deform the oil-water interface to generate complex shapes and significantly enlarge droplets. A complete understanding of the fate and transport of spilled oil requires bridging the present gap between these length scales and determining how microscale processes affect large-scale transport of oil. Here, we describe experimental results describing rising oil droplets in a purpose-built hydrodynamic treadmill which rotates to keep droplets stationary in the lab frame for continuous, direct observation. Droplets of radii 10-100 Î¼m are colonized and deformed by bacteria over several days before their rising speeds through the water column are measured. Rising speeds of deformed droplets are significantly slower as a result of bio-aggregate formation at the droplet surface compared to those of droplets of weathered or unweathered oil without bacteria. Additionally, we discover bio-aggregate particles of oil and bacterial biofilms which sink through the water column. The composition of these particles is quantified using fluorescence microscopy. These results have important implications for the study of oil transport following a spill, as colonization by bacteria can cause oil droplets to remain in the water column for months or years longer than otherwise expected. An improved understanding of the physical transformations of oil droplets during biodegradation shows promise for significantly improving models of oil spills. Additionally, the formation of sinking particles of oil and bacteria presents a new vector for hydrocarbon sedimentation and potential marine oil snow formation.
